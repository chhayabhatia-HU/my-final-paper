## Introduction
In-store marketing is usually the most important touch point for most brands. This is the point of sale and hence there are a couple of factors that affect the consumer's decision, one can be the loyalty of the consumers whereas the other can be the environment in the store. Consumer loyalty is built over a period of time and may vary at different points in time. In some cases, the consumer may be a loyalist or prefer a particular brand and would not purchase any other brand. In other cases, the consumer may prefer to try different products and would like to experiment within the category. The consumer might also get influenced by the environment in the store. Factors like discount offers or a communication on the packaging or on the shelf play an important role in the decision making of the consumer in-store.
